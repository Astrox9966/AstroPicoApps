 MMBasic is a high-level interpreted language based on Microsoft BASIC, 
 designed for ease of use on microcontrollers and embedded systems. While it retains much of the traditional BASIC syntax, 
 MMBasic is tailored for direct hardware interaction, such as GPIO, ADC, and serial communication. 
 It runs on platforms like the Maximite, Micromite, and PicoMite. 
 This manual will introduce both the basics and key features of MMBasic, 
 helping you build robust embedded applications with minimal complexity.

INTRODUCTION TO MMBASIC:
MMBasic is an easy-to-learn, high-level programming language based on classic Microsoft BASIC.  
It is designed to run directly on microcontrollers and single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi Pico.  
Unlike compiled languages, MMBasic is interpreted, making development quick and highly interactive.  
You can write code directly into the terminal, test ideas instantly, and modify programs on the fly.  
MMBasic supports modern features like structured programming, subroutines, and local variables.  
It includes built-in support for hardware interaction, making it ideal for embedded projects.  
Access GPIO pins, control PWM signals, read analog inputs, and communicate via I2C or serial.  
Programs can be stored in flash memory and run automatically on boot for standalone operation.  
MMBasic also includes file system access, allowing you to read/write files on SD cards or flash.  
It supports full-screen graphics, text rendering, and simple GUI creation on supported devices.  
Whether you're making a data logger, a game, or a home automation system, MMBasic can handle it.  
The language is beginner-friendly, yet powerful enough for serious development on constrained hardware.  
MMBasic runs on several platforms: Maximite, Micromite, PicoMite, and Windows (for development/testing).  
There is no need for external toolchains or compilers—just a terminal and your MMBasic device.  
You can edit and save programs using built-in editors or over serial from your computer.  
With structured loops, conditionals, and error handling, you can write robust embedded applications.  
It features string manipulation, date/time functions, math operations, and custom subroutine support.  
MMBasic is open and well-documented, with a helpful community and resources available online.  
For Raspberry Pi Pico users, MMBasic turns the board into a standalone programmable computer.  
The language is ideal for teaching programming concepts and experimenting with electronics.  
Even without an operating system, MMBasic gives you a friendly and powerful development environment.  
Throughout this manual, you’ll learn how to write MMBasic programs from scratch to deployment.  
Each section builds on the last, introducing syntax, logic, hardware control, and real-world examples.  
By the end, you'll be equipped to build reliable, interactive systems using only MMBasic.  
Let’s get started with the world of MMBasic!


GETTING STARTED WITH MMBASIC:
Getting started with MMBasic is easy and requires only a few simple steps to begin programming your device.  
First, choose a supported platform, like the Maximite, Micromite, or Raspberry Pi Pico running PicoMite.  
For Raspberry Pi Pico, you’ll need a USB cable to connect the board to your computer.  
Download MMBasic for your platform from the official website and install it on the device.  
If you’re using a Pico, simply flash the MMBasic firmware onto the Pico using a tool like **picotool**.  
Once flashed, your device is ready to run MMBasic code directly from the terminal interface.  
Connect to the device via a serial terminal (like Tera Term or PuTTY) to interact with MMBasic.  
The terminal window will display a prompt where you can enter your MMBasic code interactively.  
To start coding, type simple commands like `PRINT "Hello, World!"` and hit **Enter**.  
The device will immediately display "Hello, World!" on the terminal screen.  
You can also write longer programs directly in the terminal or use an editor like MMEdit.  
To enter **edit mode**, type `EDIT` and press **Enter**, allowing you to write multi-line programs.  
In edit mode, type your code, and once finished, save it with the **F2** key to store it in memory.  
Programs can be saved to **flash memory**, allowing them to run automatically when powered on.  
To execute your program, simply type `RUN` in the terminal and see your program run in real-time.  
Basic commands like `PRINT`, `LET`, `INPUT`, and `GOTO` let you interact with the system and create simple programs.  
MMBasic supports loops (`FOR`, `WHILE`), conditionals (`IF`, `SELECT CASE`), and functions for structured programming.  
To stop a running program, press **Ctrl + C**, which will interrupt the execution and return to the prompt.  
You can also use `LIST` to view your current program or `RUN` again to restart it.  
MMBasic automatically manages memory for most tasks, but complex programs may require optimization.  
External devices can be controlled via GPIO pins, which are easily accessed through simple commands.  
You can read inputs from sensors or control LEDs, motors, and other hardware directly from your code.  
To store and manage data, MMBasic allows access to files on an SD card or internal storage for reading/writing.  
The MMBasic interpreter also includes basic debugging features, such as line numbers and error messages.  
To exit the terminal or shutdown the device, use the **OFF** command or simply turn off the power.  
This quick introduction covers just the basics, but MMBasic offers deep functionality for advanced projects.  
Explore the manual for more in-depth examples and tutorials to build anything from simple scripts to complex systems.  
Now that you've set up MMBasic, you’re ready to start experimenting with programming and hardware projects!  


BASIC SYNTAX:
MMBasic syntax is simple, designed for ease of use while still providing powerful functionality for projects.  
Variables are created simply by assigning values, and there's no need for explicit type declarations.  
For example, to create a variable `A` and assign it the value of 10, just write: `A = 10`.  
MMBasic supports common data types like integers, floats, strings, and boolean values.  
To assign a string value to a variable, use quotes: `Name = "John"`.  
For floating-point numbers, use a decimal point: `Pi = 3.14159`.  
Booleans are represented as either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Example: `IsActive = TRUE`.  
Comments are written using an apostrophe (`'`) and are ignored by the interpreter.  
For example: `' This is a comment`.  
Line numbers are optional in MMBasic, but they can help with referencing specific parts of your program.  
To print output to the screen, use the `PRINT` command: `PRINT "Hello, World!"`.  
To take user input, use `INPUT`: `INPUT "Enter your name: ", Name`.  
You can combine text and variables in `PRINT` statements: `PRINT "Hello, "; Name`.  
The `LET` command is optional but can be used for assignments, like: `LET A = 10`.  
You can perform basic arithmetic operations, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `MOD`.  
Example: `Result = 10 + 5` or `Remainder = 7 MOD 3`.  
Comparison operators include: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.  
Logical operators include: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`. Example: `IF A > 5 AND B < 10 THEN ...`.  
Use `GOTO` to jump to a line number or label in the code. Example: `GOTO 100`.  
For loops, use `FOR...NEXT`: `FOR I = 1 TO 10`. To increment or decrement, use `STEP`: `FOR I = 10 TO 1 STEP -1`.  
For conditional statements, use `IF...THEN...ELSE`. Example: `IF A = 5 THEN PRINT "Five" ELSE PRINT "Not Five"`.  
You can also use `SELECT CASE` for multi-condition checks: `SELECT CASE A`.  
The `END IF` or `END SELECT` statement marks the end of the conditional block.  
Arrays in MMBasic are declared using the `DIM` keyword: `DIM A(10)`.  
Strings can be manipulated with commands like `LEN`, `MID`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `ASC`.  
To clear the screen, use `CLS`. Example: `CLS`.  
Use `WAIT` to create delays in your program: `WAIT 1000` (waits 1 second).  
To run a program, type `RUN` after writing or editing it.  
This overview covers the basics; there are many more advanced features to explore in MMBasic.
