MicroPython (MPY) is very similar to Python in most aspects, 
but there are a few key differences due to the constraints of running on embedded devices. 
While the syntax and many of the libraries are the same, 
MicroPython has some limitations and differences in terms of memory, 
hardware interaction, and available features. 
This manual will guide you through both the basics and intermediate concepts of MicroPython, 
highlighting those differences, and helping you adapt Python knowledge to the embedded world.

INTRODUCTION TO MICROPYTHON:
MicroPython is a lean implementation of Python 3 designed to run on microcontrollers 
with limited resources like memory and CPU power.
It allows you to write Python code that can directly control hardware such as 
LEDs, sensors, motors, displays, and more.
MicroPython syntax is nearly identical to standard Python, making it easy for developers to transition 
into embedded systems programming.
You can interact with MicroPython using a serial interface called the REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) 
to test and run commands live.
Scripts are usually stored on the device’s flash memory and can run automatically at startup from a file named main.py.
The standard Python libraries are mostly available, though MicroPython includes lightweight versions 
optimized for embedded devices.
You can use built-in libraries like machine, time, and os to work with GPIO pins, delays, system info, 
and hardware peripherals.
MicroPython supports exceptions, list comprehensions, and other Pythonic features, but excludes things like 
heavy modules and threading.
Development is typically done on a PC, then uploaded to the microcontroller via USB or serial tools like ampy, 
Thonny, or WebREPL.
Whether for prototyping or final projects, MicroPython offers the flexibility of Python with the low-level 
control needed for real-world devices.


GETTING STARTED WITH MICROPYTHON:
To use MicroPython, you need a supported microcontroller like a Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32, or similar board.
First, download the correct MicroPython firmware for your board from https://micropython.org/download/.
Flash the firmware onto your device using a tool like Thonny IDE, esptool, or the official UF2 drag-and-drop method.
Once flashed, your board runs MicroPython! You can connect via USB and access the REPL (live command prompt).
The REPL lets you type Python code directly into the board and see responses instantly for fast testing.
To write full programs, create a file named main.py and save it to the board’s filesystem (acts like a USB drive).
On boot, MicroPython will automatically run main.py, which is great for automation and running your own scripts.
Use Thonny IDE (recommended for beginners) to write, edit, and upload Python scripts to your device easily.
Make sure to install the correct drivers if your board isn't detected. Some need special USB or serial drivers.
If you don’t have hardware yet, you can test MicroPython logic in any Python IDE or simulate simple logic in your terminal.
Avoid using libraries that depend on full Python features like multiprocessing or tkinter, which don’t exist in MicroPython.
You can store files, logs, or scripts in the board’s internal flash memory using simple file operations (open, write, read).
To organize your code, use folders and import files using import mymodule just like in regular Python.
Keep in mind MicroPython has limited RAM, so write memory-efficient code and avoid heavy data structures when possible.
Congratulations — you’re now ready to begin exploring MicroPython’s features and writing scripts for embedded devices!


BASIC SYNTAX:
MicroPython syntax is almost identical to standard Python 3, so if you know Python, you’re already off to a good start.
Lines of code are executed top-to-bottom, and indentation is used to group code blocks like loops and functions.
Use 4 spaces (not tabs) for indentation — this is how Python and MicroPython define code structure.
Comments start with # and are ignored by the interpreter; use them to explain or annotate your code.
    Example:
    # This is a comment
print("Hello") # This also prints a message
    To print output to the screen or serial, use print() like in Python.
    Example: print("MicroPython is awesome!")
Variables don’t need to be declared with a type.
    Example: name = "Yanchep" or temp = 27.5
    You can reassign variables to different types, but be careful — this can lead to unexpected behavior.
Basic data types include:
    int (e.g., 10)
    float (e.g., 3.14)
    bool (True or False)
    str (e.g., "hello")
Strings are enclosed in quotes. You can use single ('text') or double ("text") quotes interchangeably.
    Concatenate strings using + and format using f"", .format(), or %.
    Example: print("Temp: " + str(temp))
You can also use escape sequences like \n for newlines and \t for tabs inside strings.
Math operations use +, -, *, /, //, %, and **.
    Example: a = 10 // 3 (integer division)
Booleans (True, False) are used in conditions.
    Example: is_cave = True
Use and, or, and not to combine or invert conditions.
    Example: if is_wet and not sealed:
Lists store sequences of items.
    Example: stages = ["Limestone", "Caves", "Habitation"]
Access list elements using square brackets.
    Example: print(stages[0]) prints "Limestone"
Dictionaries store key-value pairs.
    Example: rain = {"day": 1, "intensity": "high"}
    Access dictionary values by key: rain["intensity"] returns "high"
MicroPython does not support everything Python has, like set, complex, or full class inheritance features.
Stick to simple, readable, and memory-light code — embedded devices are low on RAM and CPU power.
With these basics, you're ready to write clean MicroPython scripts and interact with sensors or outputs.


CONTROL STRUCTURES:
Control structures let your program make decisions and repeat tasks — essential for dynamic behavior and user interaction.
if, elif, else — Conditional Branching
Use if to run code only when a condition is true.
    Example:
    if rain == "heavy":
        print("Erosion starting")
    elif rain == "light":
        print("Minimal erosion")
    else:
    print("No rain today")
Use comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= to compare values.
    You can combine multiple conditions:
    if wet and not covered:
        print("Water seeping in")
while Loops — Repeat While Condition is True
    while not cave_formed:
    erode()
Use break to exit the loop early.
    Use continue to skip to the next iteration.
for Loops — Iterate Over Items or Ranges
    Use for to loop over sequences or number ranges.
    for stage in stages:
        print(stage)
    Loop with a range of numbers:
    for i in range(3):
        print(i) # prints 0, 1, 2
pass — Do Nothing
    Use pass when a block is required but you don’t want it to do anything yet:
    if not ready:
    pass
Control structures are the backbone of decision-making and flow in all MicroPython scripts.


FUNCTIONS:
Functions let you group code into reusable blocks that perform a specific task or return a result.
To define a function, use def followed by the function name and parentheses:
def greet():
..print("Welcome to the Limestone Simulation!")
To call the function (run it), use its name with parentheses:
greet()
Functions can take input using parameters:
def greet(name):
..print("Welcome, " + name + "!")
You can pass arguments when calling it:
greet("Explorer")
Use return to send a value back from the function:
def add(a, b):
..return a + b
Functions can return data to store in a variable:
sum = add(4, 6)
Functions keep code clean, prevent repetition, and help with organizing simulation stages or event handlers.
You can define helper functions like:
def wait_for_input():
..input("Press Enter to continue...")
Use functions to manage stages like:
def stage_limestone():
..print("Limestone forming...")
..# stage logic here
Try to keep each function focused on one task for easier debugging and readability.


MODULES AND LIBRARIES:
Modules are reusable pieces of code that provide functions, classes, and variables. 
MicroPython comes with many built-in modules. Micropython Libraries, heavily differ from python libraries.
To use a module, import it at the beginning of your script:
import math
    print(math.sqrt(16)) # outputs 4.0
You can import specific functions from a module:
    from math import sqrt
        print(sqrt(16)) # outputs 4.0
To view all available functions and attributes in a module, use dir():
    print(dir(math))
Creating Your Own Modules
    Save your functions in a .py file to create your own module. For example, create utils.py:
    def greet(name):
    ..print("Hello, " + name + "!")
    Then, import it in your main program:
    import utils
    utils.greet("Explorer")
Popular Libraries in MicroPython
    machine: Interface with hardware components, like LEDs or buttons.
    time: Work with time-based functions like delays (time.sleep()).
    os: Work with file systems and directories.
    sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions.
Some libraries might need to be installed via upip for advanced usage.
Custom Libraries
    You can create and share your own libraries to extend MicroPython's functionality in your projects.


WORKING WITH FILES:
MicroPython allows you to read from and write to files stored on your device’s file system.
To open a file, use the open() function:
    file = open("example.txt", "w") # opens file in write mode
    file.write("Hello, MicroPython!")
    file.close() # Always close the file when done
To read from a file:
    file = open("example.txt", "r") # opens file in read mode
    content = file.read()
    print(content) # prints "Hello, MicroPython!"
    file.close()
To append data to an existing file:
    file = open("example.txt", "a") # opens file in append mode
    file.write("\nMore data added!")
    file.close()
Use with to handle file closing automatically:
    with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    ..content = file.read()
    ..print(content)
This approach ensures the file is closed properly, even if an error occurs while reading/writing.


WORKING WITH HARDWARE:
MicroPython allows you to control hardware components like LEDs, motors, sensors, and displays on the Pico.
Raspberry Pi Pico (and PicoCalc)
The Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller with GPIO pins, great for controlling hardware.
The PicoCalc is a variation of the Pico designed for small displays and portable use, ideal for your project.
PicoCalc comes with a 320x320 resolution screen for displaying graphics and text, perfect for your limestone sim.
It has GPIO pins to control external components like LEDs or buttons for input and output.
You can also use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to control brightness and motor speeds via GPIO pins.
PicoCalc uses the same Python-like language as Raspberry Pi Pico but with a focus on small screen projects.
You’ll access GPIO pins using the machine module to interact with the pins and read sensor data.
For example, turning an LED on/off:
    from machine import Pin
    led = Pin(15, Pin.OUT)
    led.value(1) # turn on LED
    led.value(0) # turn off LED
Controlling GPIO Pins
    You can configure pins as input or output:
    input_pin = Pin(16, Pin.IN)
    output_pin = Pin(17, Pin.OUT)
To read from an input pin:
    pin_value = input_pin.value() # returns 0 or 1 based on button state
To control an output pin:
    output_pin.value(1) # set pin high
    output_pin.value(0) # set pin low
Analog Input/Output
    Pico also supports analog pins for reading sensor data (e.g., temperature) and controlling motors:
    adc = machine.ADC(28)
    value = adc.read() # Read analog value from pin 28
For analog output, use PWM:
    pwm = machine.PWM(Pin(15))
    pwm.freq(1000) # Set PWM frequency
    pwm.duty(512) # Set PWM duty cycle (0 to 1023)
Hardware interfacing is vital for making your simulation interact with real-world components.


DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS:
In MicroPython, displaying graphics on a screen typically involves two main parts:
    Initializing the display hardware.
    Drawing to a buffer using the framebuf module or a screen driver.
MicroPython-compatible screens usually communicate over SPI or I2C. The PicoCalc has a 320x320 color LCD,
and it most likely uses a controller like ST7789 or ILI9341. These require a driver to function.
The framebuf module is used to handle drawing operations. It creates a buffer in memory that you can
modify with functions like pixel, text, or line, and then push to the screen.
To use a screen, follow this general process:
    Import the necessary display driver and framebuf.
    Set up communication (SPI or I2C).
    Create a buffer (e.g., a bytearray) that matches your screen's resolution and color depth.
    Create a framebuf.FrameBuffer object using that buffer.
    Use drawing functions to modify the buffer.
    Flush or update the buffer to the display.
Basic drawing functions in framebuf include:
    fill(color) – Fill the entire screen with a color.
    pixel(x, y, color) – Draw a pixel at the given x/y location.
    line(x1, y1, x2, y2, color) – Draw a straight line between two points.
    rect(x, y, w, h, color) – Draw the outline of a rectangle.
    fill_rect(x, y, w, h, color) – Draw a filled rectangle.
    text(str, x, y, color) – Write text at a location.
Colors are often in 16-bit RGB565 format. Examples:
BLACK = 0x0000
WHITE = 0xFFFF
RED = 0xF800
GREEN = 0x07E0
BLUE = 0x001F
You modify the frame buffer with the drawing functions, then push it to the screen using your display's
show() or update() function (depends on the library used).
Tips for using the PicoCalc screen:
    Stick to simple fonts and avoid large blocks of animation.
    The screen is 320x320 pixels; use the space efficiently.
    Try to limit updates to only the parts of the screen that change.
    You can create a simple refresh loop to simulate animations or UI updates.
    Typical FPS (frames per second) should be around 10-15 for smooth basic updates.
Use double-buffering if you want to reduce flickering, but this will increase memory usage.
The PicoCalc should handle basic framebuf drawing well, but avoid overloading it with constant redraws.


DATA STRUCTURES:
Data structures help you store and organize data. MicroPython supports several key types:
Lists are ordered, changeable collections. Use them to store sequences of items.
Example: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
Access with index: fruits[0] is "apple". Use append() to add items, remove() to delete.
Tuples are like lists but cannot be changed (immutable). Use for fixed collections.
Example: coords = (10, 20)
Dictionaries store key-value pairs. They’re like labeled containers for data.
Example: person = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
Access with keys: person["name"] returns "John". You can add new pairs: person["job"] = "dev"
Sets are unordered collections of unique items. Use them to check membership fast.
Example: ids = {1, 2, 3}. You can use add(), remove() and in to check if a value exists.
Arrays (from array module) are more memory-efficient than lists for numeric data.
Use when storing lots of numbers and memory matters (e.g., sensors, pixel data).
Lists, dicts, and tuples are the most commonly used in everyday MicroPython programs.
Tip: Use list comprehensions to build lists quickly:
squares = [x*x for x in range(5)] gives [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
Choose the right structure for your problem:
    List → Ordered data
    Dict → Labeled data
    Tuple → Fixed values
    Set → Fast lookup, no duplicates


ERROR HANDLING:
Error handling helps you deal with problems in your program without it crashing.
MicroPython uses try, except, and optionally finally to manage exceptions.
Basic structure:
try: run some code
except: handle the error if it happens
Example:
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
You can catch specific error types like ValueError, TypeError, or IndexError.
Example:
try:
    num = int("hello")
except ValueError:
    print("That wasn't a number!")
Generic exception catching (not ideal):
try:
    do_something()
except:
    print("An error occurred.")
Use specific error types when possible to avoid hiding bugs.
Optional blocks:
    else: runs if no error occurred
    finally: always runs, useful for cleanup
Example:
try:
    x = int("42")
except ValueError:
    print("Bad input!")
else:
    print("All good!")
finally:
    print("Finished attempt.")
Common MicroPython exceptions:
    ValueError: wrong value, like int("hi")
    TypeError: incompatible types
    IndexError: list index out of range
    KeyError: missing dictionary key
    OSError: file or hardware error
    ZeroDivisionError: dividing by zero
You can also raise your own exceptions with raise.
Example:
if temp > 100:
    raise ValueError("Too hot!")
Error handling is critical for stable apps, especially when working with sensors, files, or displays.
It prevents full crashes and lets you give feedback or retry instead.


MEMORY & PERFORMANCE TIPS:
MicroPython runs on devices with very limited RAM and CPU, so every byte and cycle matters.
Optimizing your code for size and speed helps ensure your program runs smoothly on the PicoCalc.
Avoid unnecessary variables:
Use fewer variables when possible. Reuse variables instead of making new ones unnecessarily.
Use simple data structures:
Prefer tuples over lists when data won’t change. Tuples use less memory.
Minimize imports:
Only import what you need.
Instead of from math import *, do from math import sqrt if that’s all you need.
Avoid floating point if not needed:
Use integers instead of floats when possible. Floats consume more memory and are slower.
Keep functions small:
Split large tasks into smaller functions.
Smaller functions are easier to manage and can reduce memory footprint.
Use generators:
When processing sequences, use generators with yield instead of storing everything in a list.
This saves memory because values are created one at a time.
Be careful with strings:
Joining many strings using + is slow and memory-heavy.
Instead, use ''.join([list, of, strings]).
Limit recursion depth:
Recursion is expensive. Avoid it unless necessary. Use loops instead where possible.
Use built-in functions:
Built-in functions are faster and optimized. Prefer sum(), min(), etc. over manual loops.
Delete unused objects:
Use del variable_name to manually free memory if you no longer need something.
Use gc module to manage memory:
import gc
Then use gc.collect() to force garbage collection and free memory.
Avoid large lists or dicts if not needed:
Break data into smaller chunks or pages to reduce memory pressure.
Preallocate memory when possible:
If you know the size of a list, create it with [0] * size to avoid dynamic growth.
Watch for memory leaks:
Make sure you're not holding onto objects longer than needed (e.g., open files not closed).
Check available memory:
Use gc.mem_free() to see how much free memory remains.
Use lightweight libraries:
Avoid heavy modules unless necessary. Smaller libraries are faster and use less memory.
Profile your code:
Time critical parts using utime.ticks_ms() before and after operations to measure performance.
Keep display updates efficient:
Only update parts of the screen that need to change. Redraws are costly on small CPUs.
Good memory and performance habits are essential for creating responsive, stable MicroPython apps.


TIME AND DELAYS:
MicroPython includes time-related functions in the utime (or time) module.
Use it for adding delays, measuring performance, or triggering events at the right time.
Basic usage:
Import the module with: import utime
Delaying execution:
utime.sleep(seconds) pauses the program for that number of seconds.
utime.sleep_ms(milliseconds) pauses for milliseconds.
utime.sleep_us(microseconds) pauses for microseconds.
Example:
utime.sleep(1) # pause for 1 second
utime.sleep_ms(500) # pause for half a second
Getting current ticks (time since boot):
utime.ticks_ms() returns milliseconds since device started
utime.ticks_us() gives microseconds
utime.ticks_cpu() returns CPU ticks (on some ports only)
Example:
start = utime.ticks_ms()
some code
end = utime.ticks_ms()
print("Elapsed:", utime.ticks_diff(end, start), "ms")
Use utime.ticks_diff(a, b) to get the difference between two tick readings.
Delays for animation or timed events:
Useful in display updates, games, or blinking LEDs.
Example: blink every 500ms using sleep_ms(500)
Using time for loops:
You can create loops that run at fixed intervals using ticks_ms() and ticks_diff()
Avoid long blocking delays:
Long sleep() calls freeze the entire program. Use small intervals for better responsiveness.
Real-time clocks (RTC):
Some boards support RTC to get current date/time. Use machine.RTC() if supported.
Timing is crucial in embedded systems — for animations, sensors, user input, or power saving.


INPUT HANDLING:
MicroPython allows input from buttons, keypads, touch sensors, or serial (keyboard via REPL).
Handling input is key to interactivity — whether it’s text, button presses, or custom hardware.
1. Keyboard input (text-based):
Use the built-in input() function:
name = input("What is your name? ")
2. Handling numeric input:
Wrap with int() or float() to convert input to numbers:
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
3. Input is always a string!
Always remember input() returns a string. Use type conversion if needed.
4. Handling inputs in loops:
Use while loops to continually read input:
while True:
cmd = input("Enter command: ")
if cmd == "exit":
break
5. Non-blocking input (advanced):
On hardware, use polling with time delays or interrupts.
This avoids waiting forever for input and keeps program responsive.
6. Button input (Pico/PicoCalc):
Use machine.Pin to read button states:
from machine import Pin
btn = Pin(15, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)
if not btn.value():
print("Button pressed!")
7. Debouncing inputs:
Mechanical buttons may trigger multiple times. Add small delays (20–50ms) after a press.
8. Handling arrow keys and Enter (text-based):
Arrow keys and special keys send escape sequences.
These are hard to read via standard input().
On PC, use libraries like sys or tty with caution.
On MicroPython, handling them often requires UART-based methods or GUI/button mapping.
9. Menu selection example:
choice = input("Choose: (1) Start (2) Quit: ")
if choice == "1":
print("Starting...")
10. Simulating buttons during dev:
If no buttons exist, use keyboard input() to simulate hardware actions in early dev.
11. Touch input:
Some screens support touch via special libraries or GPIO/ADC. Depends on hardware.
12. Serial input:
Data can also be read from UART or USB serial input, useful for external sensors or PCs.
13. Input confirmation:
Use prompts like “Press Enter to continue” to pause between stages:
input("Press Enter to continue...")
Input handling makes your project interactive — practice it often in loops, menus, and controls.


EVENT DRIVEN PROGRAMMING:
Event-driven programming is a style where code responds to "events" like button presses or timers.
Instead of constantly checking inputs, we wait for something to happen, then respond.
1. Events can come from:
    Button presses
    Sensor changes
    Timers firing
    Touch input
    Serial communication
2. Common methods to handle events:
    Polling: continuously check for input (simpler but uses more CPU)
    Interrupts: hardware signals that trigger functions (efficient and responsive)
3. Polling example:
while True:
if not btn.value():
print("Button pressed")
utime.sleep_ms(50)
4. Interrupts (IRQ) — more advanced but powerful:
Use when something needs instant response, like a button or sensor
from machine import Pin
def handler(pin):
print("Interrupt from:", pin)
btn = Pin(15, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)
btn.irq(trigger=Pin.IRQ_FALLING, handler=handler)
5. IRQ triggers:
    IRQ_RISING: when pin goes from LOW to HIGH
    IRQ_FALLING: HIGH to LOW
    IRQ_RISING | IRQ_FALLING: on any edge
6. Timers as events:
Timers can call functions repeatedly after a delay.
from machine import Timer
def tick(timer):
print("Timer tick!")
t = Timer()
t.init(period=1000, mode=Timer.PERIODIC, callback=tick)
7. Why use event-driven programming?
    Saves power (less busy waiting)
    More responsive (no delay loops)
    Allows multitasking-like behavior in small systems
8. Event loops:
An event loop is a while True loop that listens for various events and handles them one by one.
9. Limitations in MicroPython:
No built-in full event loop system (like Python's asyncio), but basics work well.
10. Use cases:
    User interfaces
    Games
    Timed animations
    Sensor triggers
    Power management


STATE MACHINES AND SIMULATION STRUCTURING:
State machines are an essential design pattern used in embedded systems for managing states and transitions.
Simulations, games, and interactive programs often rely on this structure for managing different stages.
1. What is a state machine?
A state machine is a model that describes a system in a series of "states" and how it transitions between them.
It’s especially useful when dealing with systems that change behavior based on conditions.
2. Components of a state machine:
    States: Different conditions or modes.
    Transitions: Conditions or inputs that cause the system to change states.
    Events/Actions: What happens when the system is in a certain state.
3. Simple state machine example:
Imagine a light system with three states: OFF, ON, and BLINKING.
state = "OFF"  
if state == "OFF":  
    state = "ON"  
elif state == "ON":  
    state = "BLINKING"  
elif state == "BLINKING":  
    state = "OFF"  
4. State machines for simulations:
Simulations like a limestone cave formation simulation benefit from state machines to manage transitions.
For example, transitions might be triggered by user input (e.g., pressing a key to move to the next stage).
5. Implementing state machines:
State machines in MicroPython can be implemented with simple if statements, while loops, or dictionaries.
For more complex systems, consider creating a class for the state machine.
6. Example of a simple state machine in a game:
class GameStateMachine:  
    def __init__(self):  
        self.state = "Start"    
    def change_state(self):  
        if self.state == "Start":  
            self.state = "Play"  
        elif self.state == "Play":  
            self.state = "GameOver"  
        elif self.state == "GameOver":  
            self.state = "Start"    
    def run(self):  
        if self.state == "Start":  
            print("Game Starting!")  
        elif self.state == "Play":  
            print("Playing the Game!")  
        elif self.state == "GameOver":  
            print("Game Over!")  
game = GameStateMachine()  
game.run()  
game.change_state()  
game.run()  
7. Events and State Transitions:
You can trigger state transitions based on various events (e.g., user input or a timer).
Use input() or sensors to trigger changes in the state.
8. Adding conditions to states:
Each state can have its own logic. For instance, in a game, you could check if a player has won or lost.
if state == "Play":  
    if player_health <= 0:  
        state = "GameOver"  
9. Using a dictionary for state transitions:
A more flexible approach is using a dictionary to map states and transitions.
states = {  
    "Start": "Play",  
    "Play": "GameOver",  
    "GameOver": "Start"  
}  
state = "Start"  
state = states[state]  
10. Simulating a system with multiple states:
For example, simulate the stages of limestone formation:

    Stage 1: "Formation"

    Stage 2: "Cave Formation"

    Stage 3: "Aboriginal Habitation"

11. Implementing stages in your project:
class LimestoneSimulation:  
    def __init__(self):  
        self.state = "Limestone Formation"      
    def change_stage(self):  
        if self.state == "Limestone Formation":  
            self.state = "Cave Formation"  
        elif self.state == "Cave Formation":  
            self.state = "Aboriginal Habitation"      
    def run(self):  
        if self.state == "Limestone Formation":  
            print("Limestone is forming!")  
        elif self.state == "Cave Formation":  
            print("Caves are forming!")  
        elif self.state == "Aboriginal Habitation":  
            print("Aboriginal people are settling!")  
simulation = LimestoneSimulation()  
simulation.run()  
simulation.change_stage()  
simulation.run()  
12. Benefits of using state machines:
    Organizes the program into distinct modes or stages.
    Easy to manage different states and transitions.
    Helps in structuring complex systems.
13. Simulations and event loops:
Using event loops with state machines ensures smooth transitions and responsiveness in simulations.


TROUBLESHOOTING AND DEBUGGING:
Debugging is essential when working with embedded systems like MicroPython on a PicoCalc.
Here are some techniques and tips to help troubleshoot and debug your code effectively.
1. Common issues in MicroPython:
    Syntax errors: misspelled keywords, incorrect indentation
    Runtime errors: invalid function calls, incorrect parameter values
    Logical errors: code runs without crashing, but doesn’t do what you expect
2. Using print statements:
The simplest debugging method is to print out variables and messages to understand program flow.
print("Current state:", state)  
print("Button pressed at:", utime.ticks_ms())  
3. REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):
The REPL is the interactive environment where you can type and test MicroPython code directly.
Use it to test individual code snippets and isolate issues quickly.
4. Handling exceptions with try and except:
Wrap code that may cause errors in a try block and handle exceptions gracefully in an except block.
try:  
    # Code that may cause an error  
    result = 10 / 0  
except ZeroDivisionError:  
    print("Error: Division by zero!")  
5. Debugging with machine and utime:
Check hardware and time-based operations using the machine and utime modules.
Use machine.reset() to restart the PicoCalc when it’s stuck or frozen.
import machine  
machine.reset()  # Resets the PicoCalc  
6. Logging and timestamping:
For long-running programs, use logging to track events over time.
Use timestamps (utime.ticks_ms()) to log when certain actions happen.
start_time = utime.ticks_ms()  
print("Started at:", start_time)  
7. Using the gc (garbage collection) module:
To monitor memory usage, use the gc module to check for memory leaks or inefficiency.
import gc  
gc.collect()  # Force garbage collection  
print("Memory free:", gc.mem_free())  
8. Checking variable types with type():
If you suspect a variable’s type is causing issues, check it with type().
x = "Hello"  
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'str'>  
9. Using assert statements:
An assert statement can be used to check conditions during development. If the condition fails, an error is raised.
assert temperature > 0, "Temperature cannot be negative"  
10. Common errors and fixes:
    Memory Errors:
    MicroPython is memory-constrained. Try reducing memory usage by optimizing code or using smaller data structures.
    Use gc.collect() to free up memory periodically.
    Pin Errors:
    Ensure that you are using the correct GPIO pins for inputs, outputs, or special functions.
    Double-check wiring and pin assignments.
    Timeouts and Delays:
    Delays or timeouts may cause issues in timing-critical applications. Use utime.sleep_ms() to avoid long waits.
11. Debugging hardware connections:
Ensure that your external components (e.g., sensors, displays) are properly connected and powered.
Use a multimeter to check for voltage or continuity issues.
12. Using an external debugger:
Advanced users can use debugging tools like OpenOCD or PyBoard for more detailed debugging, especially in more complex projects.
13. Using an IDE or editor with debugging support:
Use IDEs like Thonny or Visual Studio Code that support debugging and REPL integration for real-time feedback.
14. Troubleshooting hardware-related issues:
    Double-check the wiring and pin configurations.
    Ensure that external components are powered and connected.
    Test individual components (e.g., LEDs, sensors) with simple code examples.
15. Best practices for troubleshooting:
    Start simple: Break down your code into smaller parts and test incrementally.
    Check one thing at a time: Change one variable or component, then check if the issue persists.
    Stay organized: Keep track of the code you’ve already tested and the results you’ve obtained.
